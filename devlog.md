I have done different aspects of this project before, in other classes and in my past internship. 
For this project, I will use Python and the Subproccess module. 

## October 11, 8:04pm
Lots of progress has been made on the encrypter program. The only thing left for the core functionality is to implement
the actual encryption and decryption. Once that is finished, I will move on to the logger. Then I will work on the driver program last.

## October 12 12:14pm
I need to implement the encryption and decryption methods now. I also need to validate input, 
convert all input to caps and reject input that contains a symbol or number.

## October 12 5:35pm
Encryption and decryption are working, I need to hande user input correctly (whitespaces, numbers, etc), handle other edge cases, and add comments.

## October 12 6:22pm
Input is fully validated, all edge cases are covered, now I will begin the logger program.

## October 12 9:44pm
Logger is finished, need to work on driver next. Also need to permanently store user inputs (passkeys, words to encrypt/decrypt) from encrypter. 
Do I need to validate input in encrypter program or driver program?

## October 13 2:45pm
Began the driver program, the programs are setup as subproccesses, now the main while loop with the menu needs to be created,
std input/output needs to be directed to and from the other programs.

## October 14 6:40pm
Successfully began pipelining the programs and creating the main menu. Need to handle the history and finish the menu.

## October 16 8:32pm
Finished creating the menu for the driver program, saved history in a json file. Need to implement the option for a user 
to choose a string from the history now.

## October 18 9:48pm
Everything from the user's side is working correctly. Need to finish testing, handling edge cases, and check if logger is working correct.

## October 19 3:29pm
Entire program is working as intended, comments are added, logging is fixed, after some final testing it will be ready to submit.
